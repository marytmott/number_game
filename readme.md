# Number Game

## Rules

1. There are two players (one player, one AI).
1. Each player writes a number, hidden from the other player. It can be any integer 1 through 10. *Players can only use each number once!*
1. The players reveal their numbers.
1. Whoever chose the lower number gets 1 point, unless the lower number is lower by only 1, then the player with the higher number gets 2 points
1. If they both chose the same number, neither player gets a point.
1. This repeats, and the game ends when one player has 5 points.
